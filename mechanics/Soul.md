There are many uncertainties in the world. Academics need something to study, after all. Some things have been found for certain or, at least, somewhat certain, though. Two of these are:
1. Every sentient creature has either a soul or, in edge cases, something that stands in for a soul.
2. Energy cannot be created or destroyed.

You probably know where this is going. Every creature's soul is recycled. An echo of an echo of an echo of a lifeform past. In this game, this manifests mechanically through one trait.

# Soul
If you are playing a character in the setting of Fallen Moon, that character almost certainly has a Soul. Without a soul, one cannot be deemed sapient (with the exception of artificial Souls). The Soul is the essence of one's individuality, of one's singularity. Without it, one operates purely for survival and never for fulfillment.

Every Soul has ingrained in it a unique and intricate Sigil that determines the inhabited lifeform's mannerisms, interests, and other defining traits, as well as a myriad of miscellaneous "housekeeping" items. 

An example of one of these miscellaneous items is the conversations that a given Soul will have with The Conductor after a given inhabitant perishes and it is sent back to its birthplace. This conversation is perfectly ignored as a being gets used to it throughout a lifespan, but when faced with The Conductor, Her presence brings it to front of mind again.

This is the function of the Soul. It is the individual, the free will, and what which the body and mind cannot handle. Some would consider it a parasite. Whether or not that is true is up to the individual.

The amount of time a Soul spends between vessels depends on its virtue in life. The place it goes postmortem is not exactly pleasant, and the most virtuous Souls will be the first to clamber back to life. Between lives, though, the Soul invariably forgets the life it last lived (unless something goes *very wrong*).

## Your first character
When you first create a character, you may choose between one of two things:
1. A permanent buff of +1 to a single stat.
2. A social trait of your choosing, approved by the GM.

This trait applies to your character, yes, but it is not a trait of that character. It is a trait of their Soul. This trait is, for much of a Fallen Moon campaign, no different from any other trait of a character's. It is not unless your character dies that the trait is shown to be any different.
## Your next character
As is said in Character Creation, should a player character wind up meeting an untimely end, it is recommended that the player create a new character to enter the narrative in their stead. The character creation process is largely the same the second time around, but things differ when Soul comes up.

You should keep the Soul trait you decided upon for your first character in most cases. This represents the recycling of souls, as the death of the body means not the death of a Soul. 
If the player or GM believes that it makes sense either narratively or mechanically, however, a new player character may adopt a new Soul and a new trait to match. An example of a reason to give a new character a new Soul is if the new character has an artificial Soul. Artificial Souls, as the name implies, are completely disconnected from the energy-recycling process that most Souls undergo, ergo a character with one *should not* have the same Soul or connected trait.
